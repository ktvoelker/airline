Implement the simulation of the flight schedule

  One cycle is one minute.

  Enqueue takeoffs according to the schedule, cancelling flights for which
  there is no available aircraft.

  Decrement movement delay at all airports where it is non-zero.

  Partition the airports with zero movement delay into those with a takeoff at
  the front of the movement queue, and those without (either a landing at the
  front of the movement queue, or an empty movement queue). These are the
  "takeoff set" and "landing set".

  Execute a takeoff for each airport in the takeoff set, resetting each such
  airport's movement delay according to its capacity.

  Advance the position of each aircraft in flight, including those which just took off.
  Enqueue landings for any aircraft that reach their destinations.

  Execute a landing for each airport in the landing set with a non-empty queue,
  resetting each such airport's movement delay according to its capacity.
