Try to clean up the monad mess that has arisen

  Consider getting rid of the monad transformers in favor of building all the necessary things into the
  instruction set.

    This would mean having two operational monads: one that goes to IO and another that goes to STM.

  If we had a truly canonical replacement monad for STM, we could also move all the Object functions into it.
