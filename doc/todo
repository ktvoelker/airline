Figure out how to get user input into the simulation loop even when it's running

  There should be a channel for user commands, and a channel for responses to those commands

  Use the remaining time in each loop iteration to execute user commands

  Warn if user commands are left in the queue when time expires

  Warn if a single user command puts the time over by a lot
